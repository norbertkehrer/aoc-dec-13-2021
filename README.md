# Advent of Code, December 13, 2021 solved on the Commodore 64
This is the puzzle of December 13, 2021 of the [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solved with the Commodore 64 in Basic. This program earned me my 25th and 26th star :-)

The puzzle is here: https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/13

The Basic source code is in the file "aoc.txt". The executable binary is in "aoc.prg".

Be patient, because the program runs about 3 hours and 28 minutes to solve both parts of the puzzle.

Here is a screen shot:

Have fun.
